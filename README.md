SWAPI Project

The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!
The project was to implement an application to have access to 'SWAPI' by different categories and have allow us to discover the Star Wars world with a different eye.
